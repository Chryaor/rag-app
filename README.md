# AI Rate My Professor
### I have used OpenRouter. Change it to OpenAI API. Embeddings only work with openAI. Hugging face is a good alternative.
## Installing dependencies
- Install miniconda or a virtual environment of your choice
- run `conda activate name_of_your_env`
- use `pip install -r requirements.txt`, this will add all the dependencies needed in your virtual env
- used miniconda to create virtual env. Add it to your path variables if using a windows machine.
- use `npm install` to install dependencies

## Description
- Use embeddings to give rating of teachers and which teacher to meet based on a subject or similar.
